        level: 2
        content: |-
          {{ app.friendly_name }} requires an activation code beginning two days after
          installation.

          Free trial activation codes are published at
          https://filecxx.com/en_US/activation_code.html. Each code is valid for a fixed 
          7-day period on the calendar, and new codes will continue to be provided
          indefinitely.

          Alternatively, a lifetime license can be purchased with a one-time
          payment, which removes the need to re-enter codes weekly. Visit
          https://filecxx.com to buy a license.
